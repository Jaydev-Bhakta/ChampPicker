# ChampPicker
ChampPicker Script

Make sure you update the New_directory = "c:/Users/bjayd/OneDrive/Desktop/ChampionPicker" location
New_directory needs to be set to the location of the file. Can be found at the top of File Explorer

Also, please keep the CSV and PY files in the same folder; otherwise, the script won't work.
